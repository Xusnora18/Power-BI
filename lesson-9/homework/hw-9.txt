1. What is row context? Give an example in a calculated column.
Row context refers to the context in which DAX evaluates expressions row by row, typically in calculated columns.
Example:

TotalPrice = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice]

2. Write a measure that finds total sales

Total Sales = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice])

4. What does CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]), Sales[Category] = "Electronics") return?
It returns the total quantity sold for the Electronics category by applying a filter to the data.

5. Explain the difference between VAR and RETURN in DAX.
VAR is used to define a variable (temporary value or table).

RETURN specifies what the expression should output using the variable.

9. Fix this error: A calculated column in Sales uses RELATED(Customers[Region]) but returns blanks.
Check if there is a relationship between Sales[CustomerID] and Customers[CustomerID]. If not, establish the relationship.

10. Why does CALCULATE override existing filters?
CALCULATE modifies the filter context. It can add new filters or override existing ones, allowing for more dynamic calculations.

15. Troubleshoot: A CALCULATE measure ignores a slicer. Whatâ€™s the likely cause?
The measure uses ALL, REMOVEFILTERS, or similar, which remove slicer filters.

The slicer field might not be connected through the data model (no relationship exists).
