1. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified.

2. The two types of relationships in Power BI are:
   - One-to-Many (1:*)
   - Many-to-Many (*:*)

3. In Power BI, you create a relationship by going to the "Model" view, dragging a field from one table to another, and defining the relationship type and cardinality.

4. A "star schema" is a data model where a central fact table is connected to multiple dimension tables, forming a star-like structure.

5. In a sales dataset, the Sales table is typically the fact table because it contains transactional data (quantities, dates, product IDs).

6. To link Sales.csv to Customers.csv, use the CustomerID field:
   - Set Customers[CustomerID] as the primary key (one side)
   - Set Sales[CustomerID] as the foreign key (many side)

7. ProductID in Sales.csv is a foreign key because it refers to a ProductID in the Products table, linking each sale to a specific product.

8. If ProductID has mismatched data types (e.g., text in one table and number in another), change one of the column data types to match in Power Query or the model view.

9. A star schema improves performance by reducing complexity in joins and improving query efficiency and DAX calculations.

10. Add a new column in Sales: 
    `TotalSales = Sales[Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Price])`

11. Circular relationships can be resolved by removing one relationship or making one relationship inactive, then using DAX functions like USERELATIONSHIP when needed.

12. To create a role-playing dimension, duplicate the Dates table and connect one to OrderDate and another to ShipDate.

13. For a many-to-many relationship between Customers and Products, use a bridge table (e.g., CustomerProduct) with both CustomerID and ProductID.

14. Bidirectional filtering should be used only when necessaryâ€”for example, when filtering from both dimensions is logically required, such as for slicers affecting both sides.

15. DAX to enforce referential integrity:
    ```
    =IF (
       ISBLANK( RELATED(Customers[CustomerID]) ),
       "Deleted",
       "Valid"
    )
    ```
